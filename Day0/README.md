* [Emmet syntax](https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/syntax/)
```

```
* inline vs block
* [Span element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/span)
* [Flex](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) Flex and Grid can live together. Grid for page-level layout and Flex for component-level layout. Flex uses parent (container) and children (items) properties.
* About spaces between elements, what if you remove an element? You would keep the space? An element should be a standalone thing
* Vertical space isn't accumulated. Only the largest one wins. See [What You Should Know About Collapsing Margins](https://css-tricks.com/what-you-should-know-about-collapsing-margins/)
