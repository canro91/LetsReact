# Notes

* You can pass anything using `props`, not only strings
* `const [stateValue, FuncToUpdateIt] = React.useState(initialValue)`
* [Use prop in className](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32230635/passing-in-class-names-to-react-components)
* `useEffect` is like a side-effect. It does something after render. By default, it runs after the first render and after every update. See: [Hooks effect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)
